# Covid-related-Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis
Classifying Covid related tweets into 5 classes using LSTM (**1st Rank**, NLP challenge by Google Developers' Club, IIT Indore).

Use **NLPchallenge.ipynb** to run the whole code. You can also use Google Colaboratory to run it. Use **Pandemic_NLP_train.csv** for training and **Pandemic_NLP_test.csv** for training.

1. Five classes include extremely negative, negative, neutral, positive and extremely positive classes.
2. Performed text cleaning and stemming as a part of preprocessing.
3. Performed GloVe embedding for word representation in vector form for the model to understand.
4. Used LSTM model as they retain data memory for longer sequences unlike RNNs.
5. Achieved a testing accuracy of 93.5%.
